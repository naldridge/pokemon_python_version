<br/>Pokemon Python was built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build classes for each of the pokemon, adversaries (gym trainers), and the pokemon battle dynamics.

<br/>My focus, on this project was to build the narrative, character dialog, and general flow of gameplay.

<br/>Due to the time-constraints, we were limited to the scope of gameplay. However, my main goal was to provide the player with a seamless experience that included revisiting options without simply repeating the dialog.

<br/>In the end, I think we were able to inject some of our humor and interests into the project and provide a fun experience for the user.
